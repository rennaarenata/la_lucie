## La lucie
La lucie is the worst project that you have ever seen, written in batch, vbs, ps1, c++.
The main file is "la LUCIE.bat". That file calls the others as functions. (This is batch lol)
We have totally 14 files.

## CHESUCIESO.bat
This file duplicate all the files in the Desktop folder and then...repeat itself :)

## ILMAUS.ps1
Is a simple powershell script that makes the mouse cursor disappear

## Starta.bat + StartaDue.bat
A "in deprecation" file that simply starts ILMAUS.ps1

## bsod.hta
This file is ART. Cannot Be Explained. Try it by yourself <3

## gotcha.mp3
This file is the most beautiful and FORCED music you have ever listen to.

## icspi.bat
Starts gotcha.mp3 through nircmd.exe (nircmd is a nirsoft software NOT coded by me. Thank you nirsoft)

## iltrainene.bat
This file simply disable your life. Ok no, but is near that. That file disable all your network interfaces and disconnect you from the Wi-Fi.

## luciebela.vbs
This file simply **RAPE** the DVD player. (Open & Closes it)

## piuespansione.bat
expands **LA LUCIE**

## timeout.bat
That file activates itself at the end of "la LUCIE.bat"'s payload. It simply "asks" you if you want to continue the raping of your pc or not :)

## sera.exe
This file is written in C++. Is a precaution activated with ILMAUS.ps1. It blocks the mouse cursor in the centre of the monitor before ILMAUS make it disappear.

## uraele.vbs
This file do some shitty work whit capslock...

## CtrlDisabler.reg + Merge.bat
These files disable ctrl and some other keys. Merge.bat just import .reg (Implemented in external engine to not stop the primary process)
