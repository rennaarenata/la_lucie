## La lucie
La lucie is basically the worst project that you have ever seen, written in batch, vbs, ps1, c++.  
The main file is "la LUCIE.bat". That file calls the others as functions. (This is batch lol)  

## TODO:
- Better keyboard-disabling system, maybe uninstalling drivers? Or just putting the restart part just after the merge of .reg file...  If you *maybe* want to open a pull request... think about that

## CHESUCIESO.bat
This file duplicate all the files in the Desktop folder and then...repeat itself :)

## ILMAUS.exe (Combined with sera.exe)
**ILMAUS.exe:** Is a simple (powershell) script that makes the mouse cursor disappear  
**Sera.exe:** This file is written in C++. Is a precaution activated with ILMAUS.ps1. It blocks the mouse cursor in the centre of the monitor before ILMAUS make it disappear.

**Deprecated**  
~~Starta.bat + StartaDue.bat
A "in deprecation" file that simply starts ILMAUS.ps1 (Implemented as external engine to not stop the execution of primary process)~~

## bsod.hta
This file is ART. Cannot Be Explained. Try it by yourself <3

## gotcha.mp3
This file is the most beautiful and FORCED music you have ever listen to.

## icspi.bat
Starts gotcha.mp3 through nircmd.exe (nircmd is a nirsoft software NOT coded by me. Thank you nirsoft)

## iltrainene.bat
This file simply disable your life. Ok no, but is near that. That file disable all your network interfaces and disconnect you from the Wi-Fi.

## luciebela.vbs
This file simply **RAPE** the DVD player. (Open & Closes it)

## piuespansione.bat
expands **LA LUCIE**

## timeout.bat
That file activates itself at the end of "la LUCIE.bat"'s payload. It simply "asks" you if you want to continue the raping of your pc or not :)

## uraele.vbs
This file do some shitty work whit capslock...

## CtrlDisabler.reg + Merge.bat
These files disable ctrl and some other keys. Merge.bat just import .reg (Implemented as external engine to not stop the execution of primary process)

--------------------------------------

## This "Malware" is still being updated

*TL;DR: Starting from the worst project that you ever seen; the best that you ever seen! (e fa già ridere così)*
